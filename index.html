    <h2>Big Tobacco Hates Us</h2>
    <p>Big Tobacco has long dominated the smoking industry, but vaping represents a shift in consumer preferences that they cannot ignore. Here are some reasons why traditional tobacco companies dislike vaping:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Declining Cigarette Sales:</strong> As more people switch to vaping, traditional cigarette sales are plummeting. This decline threatens the profits of big tobacco companies that have relied on cigarette sales for decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Empowerment:</strong> Vaping gives consumers more choices and control over their experience. Unlike cigarettes, which are largely standardized, vaping allows users to explore various flavors, nicotine levels, and devices.</li>

        <li><strong>Innovative and Independent Brands:</strong> Many vaping companies are independent and innovative, often focused on quality and customer satisfaction. This disrupts the monopolistic tendencies of big tobacco, which is accustomed to controlling the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> The vibrant vaping community fosters an environment of support, education, and advocacy for responsible use. This grassroots movement stands in stark contrast to the corporate tactics of traditional tobacco companies.</li>
    </ul>
